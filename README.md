# RxjsKata

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.

## The Application

You have been requested to build an application that tracks the lifespan of feature requests through the SDLC.  This is an 'in progress' kata, see contributing we are looking for ideas to make this a comprehensive place to practice and learn RXJS skills. 

## How to complete

The objective is to use RXJS to pass the tests found in the spec files for three services:  feature-request.service.ts, feature-report.service.ts, and releaser.service.ts.  Use 'ng test' to start the test runner and track your progress.  Tests are numbered in approximate order of difficulty, though test 8 is currently the most challenging of the tests available.

## How to contribute

PRs with new tests and/or visualization of the existing observables are welcome.  Raise an issue if there are operators you would like to see integrated into the test suite.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
